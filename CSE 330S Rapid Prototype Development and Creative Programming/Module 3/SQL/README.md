## Assignment
All .txt files for the queries are in the folder "Queries", whereas all of the .sql files for the table creation are in "Show Create Table Outputs".

## Rubric:
#### MySQL Queries (25 Points):
* A MySQL server is running on my instance, with a database "wustl" and a user "wustl_inst". I included a screenshot of me using it, called "SQL on Instance.png"
* A text file containing the output of the SHOW CREATE TABLE command for each table was committed in the form <tablename>.sql
* The outputs of each of the five queries are committed as text files containing the 'entire' result (including the query and number of records found) of running each query
