## CSE 330S Rapid Prototype Development and Creative Programming
This course uses web development as a vehicle for developing skills in rapid prototyping. Students acquire the skills to build a Linux web server in Apache, to write a web site from scratch in PHP, to run an SQL database, to perform scripting in Python, to employ the AngularJS web framework, and to develop modern web applications in client-side and server-side JavaScript. The course culminates with a creative project in which students are able to synthesize the course material into a project of their own interest. The course implements an interactive studio format: after a formal presentation of a topic, students develop a related project under the supervision of the instructor.
